POLICY 1 - ALCOHOL AND DRUGS POLICY

Alcohol and Drugs Policy

Our Agency will contribute to the provision of a healthy and safe working environment in relation to Alcohol and Drugs by:

• promoting awareness of personal safety and health in relation to Alcohol and Drugs; and
• providing support to employees who wish to address their pattern of Alcohol and/or Drug consumption, in a manner that is consistent with this Policy and respects the individual’s privacy.

Our Agency does not condone or support the possession, cultivation, distribution or trafficking of illicit Drugs or the misuse and abuse of prescription medication or Alcohol.

This Policy prohibits the consumption of Alcohol during paid working hours or at Corporate functions, except where defined under the Approved Functions section of this Policy.

• encourage a moderate and responsible attitude towards the consumption of Alcohol at any work-related events;
• assist our Agency and our employees to meet their WHS obligations; and

Our Agency believes that:
• this Policy addresses the reality of Alcohol and other Drug use (and associated problems) within the community in general and reflects Our WHS obligations;
• Employees should not be adversely affected by Alcohol and/or other Drugs whilst engaged in Agency business;
• the inappropriate and unlawful use of Alcohol and/or other Drugs can adversely affect the Workplace, performance, and the health and safety of employees clients, and other stakeholders; and
• all employees of our Agency have a responsibility for health and safety.

Purpose

The purpose of this Policy is to provide guidelines for the fitness for work and management and use of Alcohol and other Drugs within the Workplace. 

The Policy also provides a framework for testing, as well as guidelines for education, counselling, and potential disciplinary action.

Application of the Policy

This Policy applies to: 
• all employees, contractors or volunteers performing work under the Agency’s direction or on behalf of our Agency;
• all offices of our Agency and other places where You may be working or representing Us, including but not limited to a client’s premises; and
• work-related functions, except as defined under the Approved Functions section of this Policy.

Definitions

For the purposes of this Policy, the following definitions apply:
• Alcohol means all food, medications and beverages containing alcohol.
• Authorised Person means the Principal or a Director of our Agency, unless otherwise stated.
• Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limit means the concentration of Alcohol in the bloodstream expressed in grams of alcohol per 100 mL of blood. The legal limit shall be determined by the applicable road rules and is 0.05 for full licence holders.

Rehabilitation Guidelines

Our Agency recognises that Alcohol and other Drug dependency is a treatable and manageable condition. Any Employee who suspects they have an Alcohol or other Drug dependency condition is encouraged to seek advice and to have appropriate treatment.

If a manager/supervisor observes a decline in work performance or conduct that You cannot explain, the manager/supervisor should involve You in an initial, informal discussion. If You indicate that the decline in Your performance or conduct is related to an Alcohol and/or other Drug problem, the manager/supervisor will encourage You to seek assistance from Your treating doctor and/or other treating professional.

Fitness for Work

To be considered ‘fit for work’, You must be in a state (physically, mentally and emotionally) that enables You to perform the assigned duties competently and in a manner which does not threaten the health and safety of Yourself or others. 
This includes ensuring You do not present for work in a state where You are Under the Influence of Alcohol and/or other Drugs. You are not to present for work when a Drug or a Non-Prohibited Drug impairs Your ability to perform Your duties.

Alcohol

Generally, the acceptable BAC level for Employees is 0.05%. This is in line with the current legal limit for driving a motor vehicle. There are different BAC levels for different classes of licences and all Employees are required to comply with the current legal limit for the class of drivers’ licence which they hold.

You should not drive Your motor vehicle if You are or suspect You are over the 0.05% limit, or relevant limit for Your class of licence.

Other Drugs

You are expected to present for work in a fit state to undertake Your duties. Therefore, You are not to present for work when a Drug impairs 
Your ability to perform Your role in a safe manner.

Non-Prohibited Drugs

Where You are taking a Non-Prohibited Drug, You should take all reasonable steps to:
• discuss with the prescribing medical practitioner/pharmacist the nature of Your duties and ascertain possible side effects of the medication which may increase the risk to Your health and safety at work;
• take any Non-Prohibited Drugs strictly in accordance with the recommendations of the medical practitioner/pharmacist and/or the manufacturer; and
• report any side effects of the medication to Your medical practitioner.

Where You are using Non-Prohibited Drugs which You believe could affect Your safety or performance, You must take all reasonable steps to notify Your manager/ supervisor of the side effects and possible safety issues associated with the Non-Prohibited Drugs.

Our Agency reserves the right to require You to undergo a medical assessment by Our choice of medical practitioner for the purpose of ascertaining the effect of the Non-Prohibited Drug on Your ability to perform Your duties in a safe manner.

Possession or Consumption of Alcohol or Illegal Drugs

Being in possession of or consuming Drugs and/or excessive Alcohol during working hours will be regarded as serious misconduct. Any Employee who is found to be in contravention of this will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.

Approved Functions

In special circumstances, such as the work Christmas party or a work-related awards night / other event(s), the Company may approve the moderate consumption and responsible serving of alcohol. You are not to drive home after a work function if You are above the BAC legal limit.

Testing for Alcohol and Drugs

Our Agency may require You to undergo testing for the presence of Drugs or Alcohol, where it suspects, on reasonable grounds, that You are Under the Influence of Alcohol or Drugs in contravention of this Policy.

Any testing shall occur either by a registered Drug and Alcohol testing company or a medical practitioner of Our choice.

Our Agency will conduct any Drug screen test and/or Alcohol screen test in accordance with the following Australian Standards:
• AS3547-1997 – Breath alcohol testing devices for personal use;
• AS4760-2006 – Procedures for specimen collection and the detection and quantitation of drugs in oral fluid; and 
• AS/NZS 4308:2008 – Procedures for specimen collection and the detection and quantitation of drugs of abuse in urine.

All information obtained through the above testing is covered by Australian privacy laws and our Agency’s Privacy Policy, if applicable. Our Agency will not use this information other than for the purposes for which it is collected.  The purposes of such monitoring and examination are to ensure the productivity, health and safety of our Agency’s Employees, to apply this Policy, and for disciplinary purposes.

If You are directed to participate in a Drug screen test and/or Alcohol screen test and You refuse to undergo such a test, this will be considered as a refusal of a reasonable and lawful direction and will constitute a breach of this Policy. It may lead to an inference that Your BAC reading exceeds 0.05% and/or that You are Under the Influence of Drugs. As such, You will be subject to disciplinary action which may include termination of Your employment.

Grounds for Summary Dismissal

The following will constitute serious misconduct and may be grounds for immediate termination of Your employment and/or Your immediate removal from the Workplace:
• Being Under the Influence of, or possessing, Prohibited Drugs in the Workplace; and/or
• Making and offering to sell Prohibited Drugs in the Workplace.

Our Agency may take whatever other action it deems necessary, or which it is required to take by Law, when dealing with allegations of such conduct as against You.

Breach of this Policy

You must always comply with all provisions of this Policy. 

If You are found to have breached this Policy, then You may be subjected to disciplinary action. The nature and severity of the disciplinary action will be determined on a case-by-case basis and the seriousness of the breach.

Examples of disciplinary action include, but are not limited to:
• Performance counselling;
• A formal warning;
• Suspension;
• Termination of employment; and/or
• Referral to a source for treatment and/or rehabilitation for Drug or Alcohol addiction.

Requirement to Hold a Valid Motor Vehicle Licence
Where You are required to operate a motor vehicle as part of Your work, You must report to the Authorised Person any matter that results in You ceasing to hold a current driver’s licence (including suspension) due to an Alcohol or Drug-related driving offence.
A failure to do so may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.

SUMMARY OF RESPONSIBILITIES

Your Responsibilities
You must take responsibility for ensuring the health and safety of Yourself and others at the Workplace. In particular, You must act responsibly by:
• ensuring You do not, by the consumption of Alcohol and/or Drugs, endanger Your own safety, or the safety of any other person, including clients;

POLICY 2 - DRESS CODE POLICY
============================

Dress Code Policy

Policy Statement & Purpose

This policy outlines the expectations Ouwens Casserly has for employee dress at work. The way employees dress reflects Ouwens Casserly’s brand and image in the market, as a leading real estate agency in South Australia. Maintaining our dress code is important to impact the way customers, clients and members of the public view Ouwens Casserly. 

As representatives of Ouwens Casserly, it's important for all employees to adhere to the dress code. 

What is Acme’s Dress Code?

Ouwens Casserly encourages employees to use their judgment when choosing their work attire, in line with our Smart Casual dress code policy. 

To assist your choices, here are a few broad guidelines you can follow:
- Choose clothes that are appropriate for an office environment
- Always demonstrate a high level of personal hygiene
- Professional dress for scheduled meetings with clients

Dress that is inappropriate for the workplace includes:
- Clothing with words or images that may be offensive to others
- Clothing with discernible rips, tears, or holes
- Swimwear
- Overly revealing clothing
- Prevalent visibility of tattoos and piercings within external, client facing meetings (inline with your direct manager’s judgement)

Ouwens Casserly recognises Casual Friday when employees can wear more casual clothing such as activewear, jeans, simple t-shirts and tops that still follow the guidelines above, where the employee doesn’t have any external meetings for that day. 

Disciplinary Consequences

A breach of Ouwens Casserly’s dress code policy may result in, or can lead to;
• A conversation with your direct manager around your future dress choices
• A written performance warning
• Progressive disciplinary action for repeated violations. 

If you feel the Company’s dress code directly interferes with the prescriptions of your faith, ethnicity or other lifestyle choices, or if you have any questions/concerns please reach out to our People & Culture Team at peopleandculture@Acme.com.au

POLICY 4 - GRIEVANCE HANDLING POLICY
====================================

Grievance Handling Policy

OVERVIEW

This Grievance Handling Policy applies to all Ouwens Casserly’s (the ‘Company’) people including employees, contractors, volunteers and work experience students. 

Ouwens Casserly is committed to maintaining a workplace that encourages collaboration, trust, co-operation, and communication, and where all behaviours are consistent with Ouwens Casserly’s values and company culture.

It is recognised, however, that on occasions, inappropriate behaviours may occur and that an appropriate grievance handling process is required to resolve complaints or concerns. 

This policy aims to ensure that all complaints and grievances are handled and resolved in an appropriate, fair, transparent, and timely manner, in accordance with SafeWork SA and Ouwens Casserly’s commitment to provide a safe working environment for all employees. 

WHAT IS A GRIEVANCE?

A Grievance is considered a real or imagined cause for complaint over something believed to be wrong or unfair.

Ouwens Casserly recognises that the scope of grievances within a workplace can range from minor grievances such as team conflict, miscommunication or disagreements relating to work, to serious cases of misconduct, bullying, harassment, or discrimination. 

Please refer to the Workplace Bullying and harassment Policy for more information on acceptable and unacceptable behaviours within the workplace.

GRIEVANCE HANDLING PROCEDURES:

There are multiple ways in which you can correctly raise an issue or concern within the workplace through our Grievance Handling Procedure. 
Depending on the severity of the grievance, you (the Employee) may choose to make an informal or formal complaint.

The principles which apply to the approach taken by management and the Company to resolve all grievances, including minor conflicts and disagreements, and cases of sexual harassment, bullying and unlawful discrimination are: 
 
a) Everyone has a right to be treated with respect;
b) Everyone has a right to “due process”, i.e. the person against whom the allegation is made has the right to know what is alleged against them, the right to put their case forward and the right for any decision to be made by an impartial decision maker; 
c) Wherever possible a non-adversarial and non-judgmental resolution to the problem will be pursued; and 
d) Complaints will be treated in confidence and where confidentiality cannot be guaranteed this will be clearly indicated. 

INFORMAL COMPLAINTS

Informal ways of dealing with conflict, disagreements, or matters of sexual harassment, bullying and unlawful discrimination can include the following action: 

a) You may wish to deal with the situation yourself but may also wish to seek advice on possible strategies from the People & Culture team; 
b) You may ask your manager to speak to the alleged harasser on your behalf. The manager will privately convey your concerns and reiterate the company’s sexual harassment, bullying and unlawful discrimination policy without assessing the merits of the case; 
c) A complaint is made, the harasser admits the behaviour and the complaint is resolved through conciliation or counselling of the harasser; and 
d) A manager observes unacceptable conduct occurring and takes independent action even though no complaint has been made. 

FORMAL COMPLAINTS
This procedure assumes that informal resolution of the grievance has been unsuccessful or is inappropriate for the severity of the issue:

a) A formal complaint of sexual harassment, bullying and/or unlawful discrimination will need to be made in writing to People & Culture; 
b) People & Culture will undertake a preliminary investigation of the complaint and will then submit a confidential report to the Chief Executive Officer. 
c) People & Culture and the Chief Executive Officer may carry out further investigations if necessary, including referral to an external mediator/conciliator. 
d) People & Culture and the Chief Executive Officer will then take the appropriate remedial and/or disciplinary action. 
e) All parties to the complaint will be advised of the outcome. 

Each person in the workplace shall: 
 
a) Fully cooperate with People & Culture in any investigation; 
b) Truthfully answer any questions asked by People & Culture;
c) Provide any document, including without limitation computer records and files, in a person’s possession or control relevant to the matter being investigated; and
d) Not make any false or misleading statement or act in any manner calculated to or which is likely to mislead the investigation.  
 
All conversations regarding the complaint must be recorded (i.e. either by audio recording or a file note detailing the conversation). Any file note detailing a meeting between an employee and their manager must be signed by both the employee and their manager to confirm the notes are correct. 

OPTIONS FOR REMEDY / CONSEQUENCES OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT

People & Culture in conjunction with the Chief Executive Officer, shall determine appropriate action as a result of the investigation. 

If someone has a complaint made against them and is found to have sexually harassed, bullied and/or discriminated against the complainant, disciplinary action will follow. 

The disciplinary action will depend on the circumstances of the case and can range from counselling the offender, to termination of the offender’s employment. 

Any action is at the discretion of the Chief Executive Officer. 

CONFIDENTIALITY/ COMPLIANCE 

Any accusation of sexual harassment, bullying or unlawful discrimination can be potentially defamatory, especially if confidentiality is not observed and a person’s reputation may be unfairly damaged. Discussions, information and records related to complaints will remain factual and confidential. Minimal but sufficient documentation will be kept. 

All documentation and details of sexual harassment, bullying or unlawful discrimination complaints will be kept securely by People & Culture.

If any employee becomes aware of any actual or possible instance of non-compliance with this Policy, they should immediately report it to the People & Culture Team.

Any breach of this policy may result in disciplinary action which may include, but is not limited to, issuing a warning or termination of employment.

=======================
POLICY 6 - LEAVE POLICY
=======================

Leave Policy 

1.  ANNUAL LEAVE

Acme Investments provides eligible employees with paid annual leave in accordance with applicable legislation. Annual leave accrues at a rate of 20 days per year for permanent full-time employees. Part time employees are entitled to the pro rata equivalent. 

Employees may take their annual leave as it accrues subject to approval by Acme (which is dependent on business requirements). Employees are encouraged to utilise their leave wherever possible and need to ensure their balance does not accrue above 20 days. 

Annual leave will be taken at times agreed upon, so far as is possible.  If this is not possible, annual leave will be taken at such times as determined by your employer.  In this situation, your employer will provide notice to you of the times in which such annual leave is to be taken as soon as is reasonably practicable.  In particular, your employer may direct you to take annual leave if it shuts down the part of its business in which you work, e.g. over the Christmas/New Year period, or if you have accumulated over 4 weeks annual leave or more, in which case your employer may require you to take a portion of your annual leave. 

Typically, annual leave will not be granted during Spring for the sales division, and during the summer months for our Property Management division.

Requests for leave should include as much notice as possible. While all requests for leave will be considered on a case-by-case basis, as a general guide, a minimum 2 months’ notice would be expected before requests of 2-3 weeks would be considered.  We would generally expect at least 3 months’ notice before approving leave greater than 3 weeks. 

Excluding during a probation period, employees may request to go into a negative leave balance of up to 5 days on the understanding that upon termination of employment Acme will deduct reimbursement for annual leave utilised if not yet accrued.  Granting leave in advance is at Acme’s discretion. 

Procedure for requesting Annual Leave

To request leave, employees should seek verbal approval from their Manager, then submit leave via Employment Hero. Your leave request will go through to your Manager for approval.  
Public Holidays during Annual Leave

If a paid public holiday occurs during an employee's paid leave, that day is considered a paid holiday and will not be counted as an annual leave day.

Annual Leave - Sales Consultants 

Sales Consultants are entitled to twenty (20) days annual leave per year. For commission-only agents, annual leave is self-funded.

In accordance with legislation, Acme needs to demonstrate that leave is being credited and debited for commission-only agents – based on the award rate of pay.

From 2023, on a quarterly basis Acme will pay commission-only agents 5 days annual leave ($940) then deduct $940 from the next commission statement. Agents will have the opportunity and be encouraged to take 5 days leave every quarter. Agents are welcome to take leave in blocks of 10 or 20 days if they wish to, however, it will be paid and deducted on a quarterly basis. 

The first payment and following deduction will take place in April and each quarter thereafter ie. again in July, October & January. Agents no longer need to put a leave request in via Employment Hero.

2. PERSONAL LEAVE (sick and carers leave)

Personal leave is the umbrella term for sick leave and carers leave. Acme recognises that unforeseen illness or injury might occur affecting the employee or their family.  Full-time permanent employees are entitled to 10 days paid personal leave (sick or carers leave) per year of service.  Part time permanent employees are entitled to a pro rata equivalent, based on the hours they are engaged to work. 

Accrual commences at the start of employment (probation is included). Accrual continues from year to year, though unused personal leave is not paid out on termination.

Personal leave may be taken as either sick leave or as carer’s leave. 

3. SICK LEAVE

Sick leave is personal leave that is taken due to a personal illness or injury of the employee.  Acme expects employees to provide a medical certificate for any single period of sick leave that extends beyond 2 days or that falls on either side of a weekend, public holiday, or annual leave day.

4. CARER’S LEAVE

Carer’s leave is personal leave that is taken to provide care or support to a member of your immediate family or household who requires care or support on account of;

• A personal illness or injury affecting the family/household member; or
• An unexpected emergency affecting the family/household member. 

As a minimum, Acme expects you to provide a medical certificate or make a statutory declaration for any single period of carer’s leave that extends beyond 2 days, or that falls on either side of a weekend, public holiday or annual leave day.  In addition, Acme retains discretion to require documentary evidence (i.e. a medical certificate or statutory declaration) for each and every absence due to carer’s leave. 

Definitions Relevant to the Meaning of Carer’s Leave

"Immediate Family"
• a spouse, child, parent, grandparent, grandchild, or sibling of yours 
• a child, parent, grandparent, grandchild, or sibling of your spouse

"Spouse" 
• a current or former spouse 
• a de facto spouse, or former de facto spouse 

"Child" 
• a natural, or adopted child 
• a stepchild
• an ex-nuptial child 

Notification Procedure for Personal Leave

Acme expects employees who intend to take personal leave to phone their Manager (or, if not available, another member of the Leadership team) no later than 1 hour after your scheduled start time on the first day of absence. Notification by text message will not normally be acceptable. 

Thereafter, you must telephone each day of absence (unless otherwise instructed by your Manager) and should make every effort to speak with your Manager directly, rather than leave a phone message.  

5. LONG SERVICE LEAVE

Long Service Leave recognizes an employee’s loyalty to the organisation and is accrued every year on the anniversary of an employee’s start date. All Acme employees (including full-time, part-time, fixed-term and casual employees) are entitled to long service leave provided they meet the requirements in the Act that applies to them.  Although each legislation uses different terminology, these requirements primarily relate to your period of unbroken employment with Acme (known as “service”). 

South Australia: 13 weeks after 10 years of service 

There are pro-rata provisions applicable on termination of employment where an employee has completed at least seven (7) years of service, in accordance with legislation.

Calculation of continuous employment for LSL

Generally, if you take a period of authorised unpaid leave from Acme this will not break the continuity of your service. You will not however accrue long service leave during periods of unpaid leave.  For example, if you take parental leave, you will accrue long service leave during any periods of service before and after taking the parental leave, but you will not accrue long service leave during the unpaid part of the leave period. 

Applying for Long Service Leave

Employees seeking to take long service leave should discuss this with your Manager as far in advance of the intended leave date as possible so that business needs can be considered - at least 3 months for long blocks of leave. Where you do not apply to take leave that you are entitled to, Acme may give you notice of when to take the leave. 

Usually, you will need to take the leave in one block, although we will consider requests for flexible arrangements on a case-by-case basis i.e. broken periods of leave. Whether requests can be accommodated will be at Acme’s discretion and subject to the relevant legislation (which imposes some limits on how and when leave can be taken). All requests need to be in writing (email) and provided to your Manager.

Public Holidays during Long Service Leave

Where a public holiday falls during a period of long service leave, the employee is entitled to take the public holiday and the holiday shall not count as one of the long service leave days.

Compassionate leave is paid leave taken by an employee for the purpose of spending time with a person who is a member of the employee's immediate family, or a member of the employee's household, that has a personal illness or injury which poses a serious threat to his or her life.  Permanent employees may take up to 2 days compassionate leave for each occasion.
Bereavement leave is paid leave taken by an employee after the death of a member of the employee's immediate family or a member of the employee's household. Permanent employees may take 2 days bereavement leave for each occasion.

7. JURY DUTY

Acme will grant up to 10 days paid leave for all permanent employees who are called for jury duty.  However, Acme may reduce any payments by the amount of jury fees (if any) the employee receives for the period of absence from work.   Employees who are called to serve on jury duty should inform their Manager as soon as possible.  They may also be required to provide relevant documentation and details related to the jury service (i.e. court issued notices, and details of the expected duration of any attendance requirements). Acme may also require an employee to request an exemption from attendance if Acme’s business needs are likely to be compromised by a prolonged absence. 
Employees are expected to return to work on any day, or portion of any day, when court attendance is not required.  
The employee should contact People and Culture to record jury duty.   

8. LOYALTY LEAVE

9. RECHARGE DAYS

We understand that life is busy and sometimes we just need a day to recharge.  To encourage work-life balance and support health and well-being, from January 2023, Acme offer all permanent salaried employees one (1) day of paid personal leave per quarter (4 days each year) for employees to use to recharge.  The leave must be booked in advance with a minimum of two (2) weeks’ notice and the timing is subject to agreement with your Manager.  Leave for recharge days will be taken from the Employees personal leave entitlement and can only be taken in that same year ie. the days can’t be banked if not used.

11. PARENTAL LEAVE

Commencing 1st November 2023, Acme provides both paid and unpaid parental leave offerings to assist employees to balance work and family responsibilities in the lead up to and after the birth or adoption of a child.  These types of leave fall under the category of ‘Employer-paid or Employer-unpaid parental leave’. In addition to these offerings, Government-paid parental leave is also available according to legislation. 

The term “parental leave” includes maternity leave, paternity leave and adoption leave.  The different terms used in this policy are as follows:
• Maternity Leave is parental leave taken by an expectant or new mother
• Paternity Leave is parental leave taken by a spouse/partner of an expectant or new mother
• Adoption Leave is parental leave taken by either parent adopting a child who is under 16 years of age 
• Special Maternity Leave relates to unpaid leave where a pregnant employee has a pregnancy-related illness and is unfit for work or where the pregnancy ends unexpectedly
• Short Paternity Leave is parental leave of up to 8 weeks, which can be taken in 4 separate periods by the spouse/partner of a new mother 
• Short Adoption Leave is adoption leave of up to 3 weeks, taken in a continuous block by the new parent within 6 weeks of the placement of the child.

GOVERNMENT PAID PARENTAL LEAVE

The Australian Government’s Paid Parental Leave scheme is an entitlement for working parents of children whereby Parental Leave Pay is available to working parents who meet the eligibility criteria. Eligible working parents may receive 20 weeks (increasing by 2 weeks each year to reach 26 weeks in 2026) of government funded Parental Leave Pay at the rate of the National Minimum Wage.
Detailed information on the Paid Parental Leave scheme is available from the Department of Human Services Office. The Department of Human Services Office assesses the eligibility of parents for the scheme.  If approved, Acme will be notified by DHS and will pay you during your normal pay cycle. For further information and to apply, please visit: http://www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/themes/families

DAD AND PARTNER PAY (DAPP)

Dad and Partner Pay is an entitlement under the Paid Parental Leave Scheme.  It’s paid directly to dads or partners by the Australian Government.  Under this scheme, fathers, and partners to newly born or adopted children can receive up to 2 weeks of pay from the Government at the National Minimum Wage rate.  This complements the already in place paid government parental leave for the ‘primary carer’ of infants. The 2 weeks of DAPP are now allocated within the total Government Paid Parental Leave available.

Applications for DAPP are made with the Department of Human Services, who will determine eligibility and amount.  This is paid directly to the employee. http://www.familyassist.gov.au/
Process for Government and Employer Paid Parental Leave 
• Employee discusses leave intentions with their Manager
• Employee reads Parental Leave checklist provided by People and Culture and provides Manager and P&C with intention letter and certificate from Doctor.
• Employee lodges their claim for government Parental Leave Pay or the Dad and Partner Pay with the Department of Human Services Office.
• Employee provides written confirmation of intention to take the employer paid parental leave offering (if eligible), including proposed dates and timing in conjunction with the government offering, and any flexibility options chosen. 
• P&C to enter confirmed leave into Employment Hero for the Employee and communicate to finance/payroll. 
• The Department of Human Services Office (DHS) decides if the employee is eligible for Parental Leave Pay and will notify the employer of this decision.
• Employer accepts DHS decision to provide Parental Leave Pay and registers their details with DHS.
• DHS provides employer with Paid Parental Leave funds in fortnightly or six-weekly instalments along with payment advice.
• Employer provides Parental Leave Pay to their employee in their usual pay cycle. Note – Dad and Partner Pay is paid directly to the employee by DHS.
• Employer pays the paid parental leave offering according to the dates input into the system, in the usual pay cycle.

EMPLOYER UNPAID PARENTAL LEAVE ENTITLEMENT (UPL)

In accordance with legislation, an employee can take up to a total of 52 weeks of leave for the birth or adoption of a child.  The total amount of leave taken in relation to the birth or adoption of the child (including leave taken by the spouse) must not exceed 52 weeks (including special maternity leave, paid and unpaid parental leave, annual or long service leave).

Parental leave is available to both parents in a relationship, including de-facto and same-sex couples. Parental leave is only available to one parent at a time (i.e. parents can’t claim parental leave from both of their employers simultaneously). The only exception is during the short paternity or short adoption leave following the birth or placement of a child when both parents may take parental leave together. 

Parents can choose which one of them will be the primary caregiver. Each parent can only take one period of long block parental leave, which must be a continuous period.  Parents may decide to swap the role of primary caregiver once during the statutory 52-week period, provided that the combined amount of leave taken by both parents does not exceed 52 weeks.

In addition, employees seeking to adopt a child are entitled to up to two days of unpaid leave to attend compulsory interviews or examinations required for adoption approval. If you have another form of paid leave available, Acme may require you to take paid leave to attend these compulsory interviews and examinations. 

Public Holidays during Unpaid Paid Parental Leave 

If a public holiday occurs during an employee's unpaid parental leave period, this day will not be paid as the employee is classified as on unpaid leave.

EMPLOYER PAID PARENTAL LEAVE  ENTITLEMENT (PPL)

In addition to the unpaid offering for employees, Acme also provides paid parental leave offerings for both primary and non-primary parents, dependent on meeting eligibility criteria. 

Acme offers twelve (12) weeks (60-working days) of paid leave for the nominated primary parent, which can be taken at any time during the total fifty-two (52) weeks of parental leave. 

Acme also offers two (2) weeks (10-working days) of paid leave for the nominated non-primary parent, to be taken at any time within the first 12 months of the birth or adoption of the child. 

Paid Parental Leave is paid at the employee’s ordinary rate of pay, and pro-rated according to part-time hours as applicable. 

The Government paid Parental Leave is still available to those eligible for paid parental leave, however the two entitlements cannot be taken at the same time. 

Eligibility for Paid Parental Leave at OC

OC’s paid parental leave offering is available to all permanent full-time and permanent part-time salaried employees, who have been employed for a minimum of 12 months at the time of taking parental leave, or who have been returned to work for a minimum of 12 months since utilising a previous PPL offering, at the time of taking a subsequent period of parental leave.

As Casual employees do not accrue paid leave, they will not be entitled to paid parental leave, however, will still be entitled to OC’s unpaid leave offering. 

As Commission-only Employees self-fund all leave entitlements, they are not eligible for paid parental leave, however, are still eligible for OC’s unpaid offering and Government-paid leave 
(Subject to income-testing).

Flexibility Options for Taking Employer-paid Parental Leave at OC:
Employees eligible to access OC’s paid parental leave offerings can nominate how they wish for their entitlement to be paid to them during their total period of parental leave, allowing support for different personal, financial situations and flexibility requirements.
Some examples of flexibility options:
• Taken at full-pay over 12 weeks, either before or after Government paid leave entitlements.
• Taken at half-pay over 24 weeks, either before or after Government paid leave entitlements.
• Taken at 75% of full pay over 18 weeks, either before or after Government paid leave entitlements. 

Employees who are already part-time may elect a flexibility option such as the options above, where their ‘full pay’ equates to their ordinary hours, and half-pay equates to 50% of their already pro-rated hours etc. 

Employees can still extend their total parental leave period from 12 months (52 weeks), up to a maximum of 24 months (104 weeks) as outlined below; however, the paid parental leave offering must be utilized within the first 12 months of parental leave.

Public Holidays during Paid Parental Leave

If a paid public holiday occurs during an employee's paid parental leave period, that day is considered part of your PPL offering. No additional payments will be added to your PPL offering should a public holiday fall within the PPL period.

Timing of Maternity Leave

Expectant mothers may wish to work right up to the time of the birth of their child.  However, if you continue to work during the 6 weeks before the expected date of birth, a certificate is required from a medical practitioner confirming that you are fit to work in your current position. 
Please note it is compulsory that any period of maternity leave taken (not including special maternity leave) include a minimum of 6 weeks leave immediately following the birth of the child.

Status of employment whilst on Parental Leave

Employees do not work during parental leave, however, do remain an employee.  While on parental leave you must continue to abide by all company policies and procedures in accordance with the employment contract (i.e. confidentiality). 

Parental leave does not break continuity of service, however unpaid parental leave does not count as service for the purposes of accruing service-related entitlements (i.e. annual leave, sick leave or long service leave). Whilst on paid parental leave, an eligible Employee continues to accrue service-related entitlements, pro-rated according to the flexibility option they have chosen to take the leave (e.g. accrued at 50% of the employee’s ordinary hours when paid parental leave is taken at half pay). 

An employee may request consent to retain Acme equipment during parental leave. If consent is not obtained, all Acme property must be returned at the commencement of parental leave. This may include items such as laptop computers, mobile telephones, corporate credit cards and security passes. Access to network data will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

Special Maternity Leave
A woman may take special maternity leave if she has a pregnancy-related illness, miscarriage, or stillbirth. 

Requesting and varying Parental Leave

All requests for parental leave should be provided to your Manager and People & Culture with reasonable timeframes, in alignment with the OC’s Parental Leave Checklist. Some flexibility with timeframes may be allowed where there are urgent or compelling reasons. For eligible Employees, requests for paid parental leave need to be submitted at least eight (8) weeks prior to the commencement date, to ensure they can be approved and logged correctly with payroll. 
All variations to parental leave must be notified at least 4 weeks prior to the commencement of the changed arrangements. Employees may shorten the period of parental leave only when agreed by the Manager and People and Culture.

Returning to work from Parental Leave

Employees are required to notify their Manager of their intention to return to work at least 6 weeks prior to the end of the parental leave. Alternatively, if an employee decides not to return from parental leave, but to resign instead, you must give the appropriate amount of written notice in accordance with your employment contract.

Employees returning from parental leave are entitled to return to their previous position. Or, if the position no longer exists, an acceptable alternative position which is near in salary and status to the previous role. Where requested by an employee, part-time employment or other alternative flexible work options will be considered and assessed on a case-by-case basis.

While you are on parental leave, Acme must keep you informed of decisions that affect the status, pay or location of your position.

Extending Parental Leave beyond 12 months

An employee who takes 12 months parental leave may request an extension for a further 12 months leave (up to 24 months in total).

Acme encourages employees to make their written request for extensions to Parental Leave at least 12 weeks before the end of the initial leave period to provide Acme with sufficient notice to consider the requested extension.

Acme will assess each request on a case-by-case basis and will take operational and any other relevant matters into account, including:

• Business, workflow impacts or costs of any proposed changes;
• Overall resource management across the whole team;
• Any detrimental effect on the ability to meet business demands;
• The ability or inability to recruit additional staff as required;
• Planned structural changes;
• Health and safety considerations; and
• Industrial laws or guidelines.

Acme will respond to the request in writing within 10 days from the date of receipt of the written request confirming whether the request is granted or refused.

The total of all leave taken by both parents must not exceed 24 months. 

Any paid parental leave entitlements applicable to the employee, MUST be utilised in the first 12 months of parental leave and will not be issued again if the parental leave is extended for up to another 12 months. Paid Parental leave offerings are offered once per child. 

Using Carer’s Leave with Parental Leave

If you are personally taking parental leave, you are not able to take carer’s leave during this time.  However, if your partner is on parental leave and becomes sick and requires care then you are eligible to take carer’s leave.  

If your child becomes sick and your partner is on parental leave then you are not eligible to take carer’s leave to care for your child as your partner is classified as the primary care giver.

All Leave requests including Long Service Leave, Annual Leave, Personal Leave, Loyalty Leave, Birthday/Anniversary and any other paid or unpaid Leave need to be discussed with your Manager to obtain verbal approval and then submitted for final approval in Employment Hero.

POLICY 7 - LONG SERVICE LEAVE POLICY FOR SALES CONSULTANTS
==========================================================


Long Service Leave Policy for Sales Consultants

The purpose of this policy is to govern all Long Service Leave requests, entitlements, and
processes for Acme Investments Sales Consultants.

LONG SERVICE LEAVE (SA)

• Long Service Leave (LSL) recognises an employee’s loyalty to the organisation and is
accrued every year on the anniversary of an employee’s start date.
• An entitlement to take LSL Leave will generally arise after 10 years of continuous service.
• An employee who has completed 10 years of service is entitled to 13 weeks long service
leave. A further 1.3 week’s leave is granted for each completed year of service thereafter.
• There are also pro-rata payment provisions applicable upon termination where an
employee has served at least 7 years of completed service, not including any periods of
unpaid leave ie unpaid Parental Leave. There is no entitlement to a pro-rata payment if
the employee’s employment is terminated on grounds of serious and wilful
misconduct, or if the employee unlawfully terminated his/her employment, such as
failure to give the required amount of notice upon termination.
• To request LSL, the employee needs to verbally discuss with their Manager their
intention to take LSL.
• Upon entitlement (at 10 years’ service) employees are expected as soon as practicable
(no later than 60 days after the entitlement accrued) to advise their Manager as to when
the employee seeks to take LSL within the 12-month period of entitlement, so that the
employer’s business needs can be considered - at least 60 days in advance for long
blocks of leave. As a general rule, it is expected that leave will be taken in a maximum
of two (2) continuous blocks.
• Upon approval, an application form must be submitted via Employment Hero.
• The Employer can direct the employee to take the LSL upon entitlement (at 10 years’
service), by providing 60 days’ notice of the date from which leave is to be taken in a
maximum of two (2) continuous blocks.
• The Long Service Leave Policy is a responsibility of People & Culture and the Chief
Executive Officer.

PAYMENT OF LONG SERVICE LEAVE

• For a full-time employee, LSL is paid at the current weekly rate of pay at the time of
taking the leave. This is based on the employee having been employed full-time for at
least the last three years of their service.
• For Commission Only employees the ordinary weekly rate is calculated by averaging
the weekly earnings over the 12 months immediately preceding the relevant date i.e.
the date the leave commences or is cashed out.
Note – weekly earnings include commission payments, referrals, auction fees and other
credits less all deductions for marketing and administration costs.

PARENTAL LEAVE/ UNPAID LEAVE

• While government-funded parental leave does not count as service, it does not break
an employee’s service. Parental payments (from the government) made to the
employer to pass onto the employee does not count as service.
• An employee’s continuity of service is also not affected by unpaid parental leave or
other unpaid leave ie extended personal (sick) leave, however, these breaks from work
are not taken into account in calculating an employees’ period of service with the
employer in relation to long service leave.

CASHING OUT

• Provision for “cashing out” of Long Service Leave entitlements rather than taking the
leave, is governed by legislation.
• If eligible, an employee may “cash out” either part or all of their LSL entitlement at 10
years’ service with approval from their manager and either, People & Culture or the
Chief Executive Officer. Any such agreement needs to be in writing and signed by both
the employee and the employer.

PRO-RATA PAYMENTS

• Payment of pro-rata Long Service Leave is only payable upon termination of
employment in accordance with state legislation.

LONG SERVICE LEAVE – SALES CONSULTANTS

• Long Service Leave for Sales Consultants will be accrued in the same manner as it is for
all other employees and will be treated as a non-debitable item.
• If the Sales Consultant wants to take the LSL or take a combination of leave and cashing
out option, this needs to be confirmed and booked within 60 days of reaching 10 years’
service and taken and/or cashed out within 12 months subject to reasonable business
requirements. Taking the leave is by agreement with the employer eg one continuous
block or two (2) blocks of leave.
• The employee will be paid 1.3 weeks for each year of service after 10 years’ service. This
will be paid on the anniversary date of employment.

OTHER EMPLOYMENT WHILST ON LONG SERVICE LEAVE

• South Australian legislation prohibits employees from participating in other
employment whilst on Long Service Leave.
• Failure to comply with these provisions may result in termination of employment, or
loss of LSL entitlements.

PUBLIC HOLIDAYS FALLING IN A PERIOD OF LONG SERVICE LEAVE

• Public Holidays that fall within a period of Long Service Leave are not included when
calculating paid leave entitlements taken.

VARIATION

• The above is subject to Management’s discretion. Acme reserves the right to amend
or terminate this policy at any time.
• This Policy must be read in conjunction with the provisions of the Long Service Leave
Act 1987 (SA).

POLICY 12 - WORKPLACE BULLYING & HARASSMENT POLICY
==================================================

Workplace Bullying and Harassment Policy

OVERVIEW

Acme Investments Pty Ltd (“Company”) seeks to provide a work environment that is safe for workers to work in. 

Workplace harassment, bullying or occupational violence decreases productivity, increases absenteeism, and is also against the law. For these reasons, harassment, bullying and occupational violence will not be tolerated by the Employer. 

The Company recognises that workplace harassment and bullying may involve comments and behaviours that offend some people and not others. The Company accepts that individuals may react differently to comments and behaviour. That is why a minimum standard of behaviour is required of workers. This standard is, as far as is possible, respectful of all employees. 

The Company recognises that workplace harassment and bullying can take place through several different methods of communication, including face to face, email, text messaging and social media platforms. As such, all methods of communication through which workplace harassment and bullying can take place will fall within the scope of this Policy. 

This Policy applies to behaviours that occur: 
• In connection with work, even if it occurs outside normal working hours; 
• During work activities, for example, when dealing with clients; at work related events, for example, at Christmas parties; 
• On social media platforms where employees interact. 

WHAT IS WORKPLACE HARASSMENT? 

Generally, workplace harassment is considered to be any form of behaviour that is: 
• Unwanted; 
• Offends, humiliates or intimidates; 
• Or creates a hostile environment. 

There are several grounds on which it is unlawful to harass a person including on the basis of sex, pregnancy, age, race, disability and marital status. 

One specific category of harassment is sexual harassment, which is generally considered to be: 
• Unwanted sexual advances, or unwelcome requests for sexual favours; or
• Other unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature; and 
• In circumstances where a reasonable person would have expected that the person would be offended, humiliated, or intimidated by the behaviour. 

Sexual harassment can be physical, electronic and verbal. Some examples include:

Physical:
• Unwelcome touching, stroking, hugging, kissing, staring or leering; 
• Stalking, or persistent, unwelcome proposals;
• Inappropriate contact or standing too close;
• Requests or pressure for dates or sex of any kind; 
• Making jokes at the expense of a person with a disability; 
• Verbal abuse or derogatory comments based on race; and 
• Abuse based on a person’s age.

Electronic:
• Sexually explicit comments, posts, texts, emails or on social media; 
• Electronic stalking, sharing or threatening to share images without your consent; 
• Sending pornographic material or unwanted gifts.

Verbal:
• Repeated requests to go out (or date);
• Intrusive questions about your private life;
• Making personal comments about your physical appearance; 
• Indecent phone calls or voice messages; 
• Suggestive comments, jokes or innuendo that you find offensive;
• Sexual gestures, or tales of sexual performance; 
• Requests for sex or sexual favours.

This is not an exhaustive list. 

Workplace harassment usually consists of a pattern of unwelcome behaviour. However, it can also consist of a sole act of a serious harassing nature. In some instances, the harassment might take place outside the workplace: for example, at a work-related social function, or when a worker makes unwelcome phone calls to another worker at their home or follows them home from work. 

If you go to another workplace to do your work there, it is also against the law and a breach of this policy to harass someone who is working there. 

WHAT IS WORKPLACE BULLYING? 

Workplace bullying occurs when an individual, or a group of individuals, repeatedly behaves unreasonably towards an employee, or a group of employees, at work and the behaviour creates a risk to health and safety. 

Examples of workplace bullying include: 
• Abusive, insulting or offensive language or comments;
• Aggressive and intimidating conduct;
• Belittling or humiliating comments;
• Unjustified criticism or complaints;
• Spreading misinformation or malicious rumours;
• Victimisation;
• Practical jokes or initiation ‘ceremonies’;
• Pressure to behave in a particular manner;
• Repeatedly displaying offensive material;
• Deliberately excluding someone from work-related activities or events;
• Withholding information that is vital for effective work performance;
• Deliberately setting unreasonable timelines, constantly changing deadlines, too much or too little work;
• Repeatedly setting tasks unreasonably below or beyond a worker’s skill level;
• Denying access to information, supervision, consultation or resources to an employee’s detriment;
• Changing work arrangements such as rosters and leave to deliberately inconvenience.

Reasonable management action does not constitute bullying. 

Examples of reasonable management action include: 
• Setting reasonable performance goals; 
• Allocating working hours where the requirements are reasonable; 
• Transferring an employee for operational reasons; 
• Deciding not to promote an employee in circumstances where a reasonable process is followed and documented; 
• Discussing an employee’s unsatisfactory performance with the worker; 
• Discussing an employee’s inappropriate behaviour in an objective and confidential manner;
• Implementing organisational change or restructuring; or
• Termination of employment or engagement of an employee. 

WHAT IS OCCUPATIONAL VIOLENCE?

Occupational violence is considered to be any incident where a person is physically attacked or threatened in the workplace, whether by a co-worker, subcontractor or client. 

It includes (but is not limited to): 
• Striking, biting, spitting, scratching, hitting, kicking or any other type of direct physical contact;
• Throwing objects
• Pushing, shoving, tripping, grabbing
• Verbal threats
• Armed robbery
• Sexual assault
• Attacking with knives, guns, clubs or any other weapon.

Work-related violence can cause both physical and psychological harm to employees, and result in significant economic and social costs to them, their family, the business where they work and the wider community. Like all work health and safety risks, it must be managed.

MANAGERS ROLE 

Managers have an important role to play in terms of fostering a culture that does not tolerate or encourage harassment, bullying and occupational violence and, as employees of the Employer, should ensure that they do not engage in any conduct of this nature. 

Managers should also ensure that employees understand this policy and the consequences of non-compliance. When managers and supervisors observe harassment, bullying or occupational violence occurring, they should take steps to stop this conduct and warn the person of the consequences if the behaviour continues (including disciplinary measures up to and including termination of employment). 

Managers must also treat all grievances raised by employees in accordance with the Employer’s Grievance Handling Policy. 
Inappropriate acts, such as indecent exposure, stalking, sexual assault and obscene or threatening communications (e.g. phone calls, letters, emails, text messages and posts on social media) should be referred to the police as well as managed under WHS laws. It may also need to be reported to SafeWork SA as a notifiable incident.

EMPLOYEES ROLE

The Employer expects employees: 
• Not to engage in harassment, bullying or occupational violence; 
• Not to aid, abet or encourage others to engage in harassment, bullying or occupational violence; 
• To behave in a responsible and professional manner; 
• Treat others in the workplace with courtesy and respect; 
• Listen and respond appropriately to the views and concerns of others; and to be fair and honest in their dealings with others. 

ARE YOU EXPERIENCING HARASSMENT, BULLYING OR BEING SUBJECT TO VIOLENCE? 

Complaints of harassment, bullying, and occupational violence will be taken seriously and will be handled in accordance with the Employer’s Grievance Handling Policy. 
If you make a complaint of workplace harassment, bullying or occupational violence it will be taken very seriously and will be dealt with sympathetically and in a confidential manner. 

You will not be victimised or treated unfairly for making a complaint. 

If the claim is found to be substantiated, the Employer will act in accordance with SafeWork SA and the Employer’s Grievance Handling Policy. 
Please note that any worker found to have fabricated a complaint will be subject to disciplinary action under the Disciplinary & Termination Policy, up to and including termination of employment. 

OTHER MEASURES 

The Employer also recognises the need for open communication amongst employees and training in relation to behavioural standards and will hold regular staff meetings to address standards, expectations and any issues. The frequency and dates of these meetings will be determined by the management of the Employer. 

Staff meetings provide employees with an avenue to air issues in a forum that is controlled by the Employer and does not harm the reputation of the person or the nature of the working environment.

POLICY 13 - WORKPLACE BULLYING & HARASSMENT POLICY
==================================================

Workplace Flexibility Policy

Acme Investments (Acme) believes in providing employees with flexibility in their working arrangements where it is possible and appropriate. This policy provides a framework for employees to work remotely or from home.

The objectives are to:
- Clarify who will be permitted to work remotely and in what circumstances.
- Ensure that adequate provision is made for workplace health and safety where employees work remotely. 
- Ensure employees are aware of their obligations and responsibilities in relation to working remotely.

People and Culture in conjunction with Managers are responsible for the administration of this policy and implementing procedures to ensure that it is followed.

Any employee who is authorized to work remotely is responsible for:
- Ensuring confidentiality of work related information;
- Privacy Act compliance is to be adhered to particularly around personal information
- Complying with policies and procedures whilst working remotely, including workplace health and safety policies and procedures.

AUTHORISATION TO WORK REMOTELY

Employees must not work remotely unless they are approved to do so. Approval may be on an occasional basis, or it may be for a long-term arrangement. Approval may be varied or revoked at any time at Acme’s discretion. There is no automatic entitlement for anyone to work from home.

All applications will be reviewed by Acme on a case-by-case basis. Approval to work from home is subject to compliance with this policy and needs to be granted by your Manager for an occasional basis, or, in cases where a long-term arrangement is requested, the Manager and People and Culture.


POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

While working remotely the employee is to comply with all Acme policies and procedures and do all things reasonably necessary to ensure that Acme complies with all policies and procedures.

Some points to consider regarding working remotely; 
- Workflow impacts (team meetings, interactions, being contactable, achievement of outcomes, etc.) 
- The need for colleagues and clients to access you.
- The home set up with no WH&S risks – particularly if this is an on-going arrangement, an assessment is required.
- Any detrimental effect upon your work performance or the performance of the team.
- Any detrimental effect on the ability to meet client/stakeholder demands.
- Consistent satisfactory performance
- Additional technology required to support the flexibility and any costs associated.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Where you require additional equipment to work remotely, discuss these requirements with your Manager. Where it is agreed that equipment is necessary, it will be provided at Acme’s expense, subject to reasonable conditions.

All property and equipment belonging to Acme, or which Acme provides to an employee to assist them to work from home, must only be used as authorised by Acme. Equipment must be stored safely and securely and treated with all due care. This includes taking all reasonable security precautions in the home to prevent burglary, theft, loss or damage.

ACCESS

As required, Acme employees may be granted the ability to connect to the corporate network whilst away from the office. The following terms and conditions apply:
1. Privacy Act compliance is to be adhered to particularly around personal information.
2. Access to Acme technology requires high speed and reliable internet service to work effectively.
3. Acme will provide the technology on approved devices, yet the internet connection is the responsibility of the employee.
4. Access to use technology is subject to manager approval and can be recalled at Acme’s discretion.

INSURANCE

Where Acme’s public liability and other insurances do not fully cover the working from home arrangement (including property and equipment), those policies may need to be extended. Alternatively, the employee may agree to take out their own insurance. Acme may require an employee to provide evidence of any personal insurance policies which provide coverage for the work from home arrangement.

You should be aware that working remotely may affect your domestic insurance cover. It is the employee’s responsibility to check these issues with their own insurer. Acme does not take any responsibility for the impact that working from home has on such insurances.

WORKPLACE HEALTH AND SAFETY

Where an employee works from home, their home becomes a workplace for the purposes of workplace health and safety legislation. Accordingly, both the employee and Acme is required to ensure that the workplace is safe and free from risk.

In light of Acme’s health and safety obligations, the following minimum steps are required. Acme will consult with the employee in relation to these steps and in turn the employee is to cooperate with Acme in relation to them:
- A risk assessment is to be undertaken before an employee is allowed to work from home. Where an existing employee has already commenced working from home, a risk assessment should be scheduled as soon as possible. Periodic and occasional workplace inspections may also be conducted by Acme.
- The employee is to allow Acme representatives to inspect their home workspace at any time during work hours, or at other times as agreed (including any incidental areas which may be used during breaks, such as kitchen and bathroom facilities).
- Where a risk is identified, Acme or the employee are to take steps to eliminate or control the risk (i.e. installation or provision of suitable equipment, training in safe use of equipment, tagging of electrical equipment, elimination of fire hazards, etc.)
- The employee should ensure that adequate first aid facilities are provided when the employee is working from home. This requires the provision of a First Aid Kit (unless the employee provides and maintains an acceptable kit) and may include First Aid training.
- The employee must keep the home-work space clean, free from obstructions and comply with Acme’s policies, procedures and directives in relation to health and safety.

WORKING FROM HOME CHECKLIST

The following checklist outlines some of the key considerations which need to be taken into account to ensure a safe and compliant home-work environment.

General
- Have you discussed working from home with your Manager?
- Have you put a request in writing to your Manager and People & Culture?
- Do you have a plan for how you will stay in touch with your Manager and team while working from home?

Ergonomic Equipment/WH&S 
- Do you have an ergonomically safe work environment? People and Culture will organise an assessment of your work environment, particularly if you are working from home on a regular basis.
- Have any potential risks been eliminated or controlled?
- Have specific WH&S procedures been documented? i.e. an evacuation plan
- Do you require additional equipment to work from home, i.e. to do your role and to ensure a safe work environment?
- Do you have somewhere secure to store work and equipment and ensure all reasonable security precautions are taken to prevent burglary, theft, loss or damage?
- Do you have an adequate First Aid kit?
- Is your workspace clean and free from obstructions and potential hazards?

Insurance
- Does your home/lease plan include public liability insurance cover for working from home arrangements (including property and equipment)?
- Have you checked if working from home affects your domestic insurance coverage?

Confidentiality  
- Do you have access to confidential, commercially sensitive information, or information required to be managed/secured under privacy laws and/or aligned with Acme policy? If yes, do you have a locked cabinet or secure storage space in which to keep this information?

All Employees working from home will be required to complete the Acme Office Workstation Checklist and provide to the People and Culture team. 

Acme encourages employees to consider these and any other relevant factors before making a request for part time/flexible arrangements and to propose suggestions which mitigate possible negative business impacts. Ultimately, the success of any flexible work arrangement will depend upon Acme’s willingness to allow and support such arrangements, and the willingness and commitment of employees to make the arrangement work.
